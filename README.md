# spring-ai-in-action

In this tutorial, we'll be putting AI to work in some fascinating scenarios using Spring Boot.

Spring-AI is extremely fresh and currently lacks a stable version. However, we anticipate the release of a stable version in the future.

P.S. Great news !
As of December 2023, the Spring-AI project has transitioned from its experimental phase and has officially achieved recognition and support as a mature project. The project's development is motivated by a commitment to advancing AI concepts, and the Spring team provides a comprehensive resourceâ€”Spring AI Reference (https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html). This valuable source covers the latest releases, project updates, and offers insights into the core AI concepts, including models, prompts, and more. Stay informed and explore the innovative efforts of the Spring team through this resource.
